## Acknowledgements
Thank you for your interest in "Finding Love - A Hmong New Year Game!" This game would not have been possible without the many amazing individuals online who have posted various resources on Renpy (the engine that made this visual novel possible). I would also like to thank the amazing composers who allowed my game to come to full life with their music. This also extends to those who uploaded the amazing sound effects that I used in the game- without the sounds, things would've been extremely boring.

I would also like to thank my friends and family who supported me while I made this game, gave feedback, and brainstormed ideas with me. 

## Author's Note
This is a one hit game. I'll likely never come back and modify it and any flaws or flatness in writing are purposely left unattended. 
This project is intended to tease the idea of a Hmong game and Visual Novels- at its core, it's a game I made for my pure enjoyment. I hope that this can inspire those in the Hmong Community to create something with more substance and complexity. 

Again, thank you for playing!
